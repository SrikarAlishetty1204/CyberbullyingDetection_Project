# CyberbullyingDetection_Project

Developed and implemented a machine learning algorithm to detect instances of cyberbullying in digital communication channels.
Analyzed large volumes of text data using natural language processing and supervised learning techniques to achieve a highlevel of accuracy in identifying cyberbullying.
Used html and css to create a web page.I used bootstrap to add more styling to my webpage
Used flask to connect the backend of my project with the front end
Used svm algorithm as it gave me more accuracy then all other algorithms
